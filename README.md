Hello everyone,

This project is a program I've developed solely for my own use. It's an application for managing passwords, designed to run in a local environment without relying on networks like the cloud, so it's likely secure. However, since it's intended for personal use, I haven't focused much on general security considerations.

I plan to release this application publicly, but I cannot take responsibility for any issues that may arise from its use. Please use it at your own risk.
